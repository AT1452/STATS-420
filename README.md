# University of Illinois, UC - STATS 420
### Brandon Ching, PhD

This repository contains most of the work I completed for UIUC STATS 420 as part of my MCS-DS program. The Rmd files represent my best efforts to complete the project/homework requirements. Not all are correct and there are many instances where, programmatically speaking, there are less than ideal solutions to the problem. 

This work should be seen as a progression of learning. Prior to this class, I had no experience in R and was VERY rusty with stats in general as it had been many years since my last graduate math course.
